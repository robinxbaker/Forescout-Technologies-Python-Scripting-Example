# Forescout-Technologies-Python-Scripting-Example
**A basic example of python scripting**

Hello, and welcome to my python scripting project.

The python script, contained in get_info_data.py, searches the given directory, in this case /data, and looks for sub-directories 
with the string "info" in the name. 

It then creates a new /info directory, copies all of the previous directories found with info in the name, removes "info" 
from the copies' names, and stores them in the new /info directory. 

It then creates a .json file with the information about the files, compiles all of the .go files, and runs all of the .go files.
